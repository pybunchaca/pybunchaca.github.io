# Introduction

Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Hoang, and I am a senior software engineer with a passion for Python.

On this website, I aim to provide resources for anyone looking to learn Python and apply it to a wide range of tasks, including algorithms, data structures, automation, finance, image processing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

As I create and share these resources, I hope not only to teach Python to others, but also to continue learning and growing as a Python developer myself. After all, as the saying goes, "Men learn as they teach."

I hope you find my website helpful and informative, and I look forward to supporting you on your Python learning journey.
