# Introduction to Python and Setting up a Development Environment

Python is a powerful, high-level programming language that is widely used in a variety of fields, including web development, data science, and machine learning. Its simple syntax and easy-to-use libraries make it a great choice for beginners.

Before diving into programming with Python, it is important to have a development environment set up. This includes installing Python on your computer, as well as a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write and edit your code.

The first step is to download and install Python from the official website (python.org). Be sure to download the latest version of Python 3, as Python 2 is now deprecated.

Next, you will need to choose a text editor or IDE. Some popular options for beginners include IDLE (which comes with Python), Thonny, or PyCharm. These tools will help you write and edit your code, as well as run and debug your programs.

Once you have Python and a text editor/IDE installed, you can start writing your first Python program. A simple program to get started is the "Hello, World!" program, which simply prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

To run the program, open your text editor/IDE and type in the following code:

```python enablePythonEditor
print("Hello, World!")
```

And then save the file with .py extension and run it using your IDE or command prompt.

Congratulations! You have just written and run your first Python program. Now that your development environment is set up, you are ready to start learning the basics of Python programming.

In conclusion, getting started with Python is easy. By installing Python and a text editor or IDE, you have everything you need to start writing and running Python programs. With its simple syntax and powerful libraries, Python is a great choice for beginners looking to learn programming.
